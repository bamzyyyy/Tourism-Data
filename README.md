# 🌍 Tourism Performance Dashboard


## 📖 Project Overview
This dashboard is a new initiative I launched to visualize tourism performance across multiple regions — focusing on monthly revenue, visitor trends, and customer satisfaction. Built using Tableau, it’s designed to help analysts, tourism boards, and decision-makers track KPIs, uncover trends, and drive smarter planning.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Tableau – Interactive visualizations & dynamic dashboard interface

- Microsoft excel / CSV – Data wrangling and initial transformation

- Analytical Techniques – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), time-based comparison, trend forecasting

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

- KPI Cards with trend lines showing Revenue, Tourist Visits, and Satisfaction — each tied to a month parameter that lets users compare selected months with their previous performance

- Monthly Revenue vs. Tourist Visits – Combined bar and line chart tracking overall tourism flow

- Regional Breakdown – Bar and pie charts show revenue and visit volume by region

- Satisfaction Heatmap – Matrix chart highlights how satisfaction changes by region and month

- Interactive Controls – Filter by month or region and watch all charts respond dynamically

### 🔍 Key Questions Explored
- Which regions consistently lead in visits, revenue, and satisfaction?

- What seasonal patterns affect tourist volumes and experiences?

- Where do opportunities exist for boosting satisfaction and economic return?

- How do regional trends compare month-over-month?

### 📈 Insights from the Dashboard
🌟 South Region ranks highest across all key metrics — suggesting strong infrastructure and tourist appeal.

🚧 Central Region underperforms — a clear candidate for strategic investment and improvement.

📅 July delivers the highest satisfaction, while January sees lower scores, revealing a potential for seasonal experience optimization.

📊 May marks a visitor peak — uncovering what drives this can help replicate success in other months.

### 💡 Recommendations
- Off-Season Promotions: Boost January’s performance by offering seasonal travel packages

- Regional Development: Prioritize Central Region improvements for more balanced growth

- Experience Design: Study South Region’s model and scale key elements to other regions

- Campaign Timing: Leverage peak months like May for testing high-impact campaigns

### 📂 Data Source
Built using sample tourism data to simulate real-world dynamics and demonstrate how data storytelling and interactivity can empower tourism analytics.
